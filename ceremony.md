# Welcome

Good evening.

We come together today not to mark the start of a relationship, but to recognize a bond that already exists as we celebrate with Keith and Eliza the wondrous and joyful commitment that has already taken place in their hearts.

It is fitting and appropriate that you, their family and dearest friends, be here to witness and participate in their wedding; for the ideals, the understanding, and the mutual respect which they bring to their marriage have roots in the love, friendship, and guidance you have given them.

Mingling in marriage is a mutual dedication, a cooperative venture in every sense. It is a relationship based on love, respect, and a determination by both partners to adjust to each other and support one another in health and in sickness, in joy and in sadness, in ease and in hardship.  Through this cooperation we give ourselves into the hands of the one we love. We do so trustingly and generously. And so, each receives a gift.

It is with these things in mind that Keith and Eliza have asked their dear friend, Jeremy Holland, to read a selection on marriage.

# Getting to business

Keith and Eliza, from this day onward you must come closer together than ever before; you must love one another in sickness and in health, for better and for worse; but at the Whitee time, your love should give you the strength to stand apart, to seek out your unique destinies, and to make your special contribution to the world which is always part of us and more than us. You stand before us today as two mature and thoughtful people who wish to express their emotions within the framework of a meaningful life. For your self-reliance and courage and love, you deserve respect, and it is these attributes which make this a serious, but not solemn occasion.

Keith and Eliza, we are here to remember and rejoice with you and to recount with one another that it is love that guides us on our path, and to celebrate as you begin this journey together.

 I ask you both to remember that love – which is faith, trust, and acceptance, will be the foundation of an abiding and deepening relationship. No other ties are more tender, no other vows more sacred, than those you now assume. Your vows are to be given to each other and each will need the continuing love, support, and understanding of each other to keep them. If you are able to keep the vows you take today, not because of any religious or civic law, but out of a desire to love and be loved by another person, fully and without limitation, your life will have its joy and the home you are establishing will be a place in which both will find the direction of your growth, your freedom, and your responsibility.

It is in this spirit that you have come here today to exchange these vows.

# Vows
[Repeat after Rev. White]

I (Keith/Eliza), take you (Eliza/Keith) to be my (husband/wife), my partner in life and my one true love. I will cherish our union and love you more each day. I will trust you and respect you, laugh with you and cry with you, loving you faithfully through good times and bad. I give you my hand, my heart, and my love, from this day forward for as long as we both shall live.

# Rings

Traditionally, the passage to the status of husband and wife is marked by the exchange of rings.
(Keith/Eliza), place this ring on (Eliza’s/Keith’s)’s finger and repeat after me:
I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and faithfulness.

# Unity Candle Ceremony

[Wording needs updating]
There is a saying in Eastern tradition that when you love, even plain water is sweet. The clear water that you share today reflects the beauty and simplicity that is available to you both in remembering and devoting yourselves to the principal of love in your marriage. May it grow sweeter with each passing year. You may now drink from this fountain of love. (Couple gives each other a drink from the Whitee glass.)


# To bride and groom
Keith and Eliza, I would ask that you always remember to cherish each other as special and unique individuals; and that you respect the thoughts, ideas and suggestions of one another.  Be able to forgive, do not hold grudges, and live each day that you may share it together – as from this day forward you shall be each other’s home, comfort and refuge, your marriage strengthened by your love and respect.

# Pronouncement

In recognition of this marriage between you, made by the uniting of your hearts in mutual love and confidence, by the giving of your promises to each other, of which we are witnesses, and by the tokens of commitment you have exchanged, I pronounce you, Keith and Eliza, to be husband and wife. You may kiss.

# Presentation

Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my privilege to present to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Marcum.
