# Welcome - Jameswhite
Mawwiage. Mawwiage is what bwings us togevvah today - not to mark the start of a relationship, but to recognize a bond that already exists as we celebrate with Keith and Eliza the wondrous and joyful commitment that has already taken place in their hearts.

That you are all here to witness and participate in these vows is fitting, as the ideals, understanding, and mutual respect they bring to their marriage have roots in the love, friendship, and guidance you have shared with them.

Committing to a marriage is a mutual dedication and a cooperative venture in every possible sense. It is a relationship based on love, respect, and a determination by both partners to adjust to each other and support one another in health and in sickness, in joy and in sadness, in ease and in hardship. Through this cooperation we place our own happiness - without reservation - into the care of the one we love, and we do so trustingly and generously; each sacrifices a part of themselves, but gains a gift far more precious than that which was lost.

It is with these things in mind that Keith and Eliza have asked their dear friend, Jeremy Holland, to read a selection on marriage.

# Reading - Jeremy
Union from "The Beginning to End" by Robert Fulghum

You have known each other from the first glance of acquaintance to this point of commitment. At some point, you decided to marry. From that moment of yes to this moment of yes, indeed, you have been making promises and agreements in an informal way. All those conversations that were held riding in a car or over a meal or during long walks — all those sentences that began with "When we're married" and continued with "I will and you will and we will"- those late night talks that included "someday" and "somehow" and "maybe"- and all those promises that are unspoken matters of the heart. All these common things, and more, are the real process of a wedding. The symbolic vows that you are about to make are a way of saying to one another, " You know all those things we've promised and hoped and dreamed- well, I meant it all, every word." Look at one another and remember this moment in time. Before this moment you have been many things to one another- acquaintance, friend, companion, lover, dancing partner, and even teacher, for you have learned much from one another in these last few years. Now you shall say a few words that take you across a threshold of life, and things will never quite be the same between you. For after these vows, you shall say to the world, this- is my husband, this- is my wife.

# Getting to business - Jameswhite
Keith and Eliza, from this day onward you must come closer together than ever before; you must love one another in sickness and in health, for better and for worse; but at the same time, your love should give you the strength to stand apart, to seek out your unique destinies, and to make your special contribution to the world which is always part of us and more than us. You stand before us today as two mature and thoughtful indivduals who wish to build a meaningful life together based on the foundations of self-reliance, courage, and love. These attributes deserve our respect, and this ceremony - your solemn commitment thereto - make this a serious, but overwhelmingly joyful occasion.

Keith and Eliza, we are here to remember and rejoice with you, and to recount with one another that it is love, trust, and dedication that guide us on our path, and to celebrate with you as you begin this journey together.

I ask you both to remember that love – which is composed of faith, trust, and acceptance - will be the foundation of an abiding and ever-growing relationship. No other ties are more tender, no other vows more sacred, than those you now assume. They are to be given to each other sincerely, but with the sure knowledge that you will both need the continuing love, support, and understanding of each other to keep them. If you are strong enough so to do - not because of any religious or civic law, but out of a genuine desire to love and be loved by another person, fully and without limitation - then your lives will have more than their fair share of joy, and the home you are creating together will be a place in which both will find the cardinal direction of all those roads that you have yet to walk, sometimes separately, but ultimately and most often together.

It is in this spirit that you have come here today to exchange these vows.

# Vows
[Repeat after Rev. White]

I (Keith/Eliza), take you (Eliza/Keith) to be my (husband/wife), my partner in life and my one true love. I will cherish our union and love you more each day. I will trust you and respect you, laugh with you and cry with you, loving you faithfully through good times and bad. I give you my unconditional friendship and steadfast support, from this day forward for as long as we both shall live.

# Rings
Traditionally, the passage to the status of husband and wife is marked by the exchange of rings.
(Keith/Eliza), place this ring on (Eliza’s/Keith’s)’s finger and repeat after me:
I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and faithfulness.

# Unity Candle Ceremony
There is a long Western tradition of representing the eternal by means of a single, bright flame. This candle that you light together today reflects your dedication. The flame will sometimes flicker, just as you will sometimes find yourselves on shaky ground with one another. The flame will sometimes gutter as you will sometimes be exhausted. The flame, however, will not extinguish as long as there are wick and wax to feed it, just as this union shall not break as long as your determination and steadfastness endure.

# To bride and groom
Keith and Eliza, I would ask that you always remember to cherish each other as special and unique individuals; and that you respect the thoughts, ideas and suggestions of one another.  Be able to forgive, do not hold grudges, and live each day that you may share it together – as from this day forward you shall be each other’s home, comfort and refuge, your marriage strengthened by your love and respect.

# Pronouncement
In recognition of this marriage between you, made by the uniting of your hearts in mutual love and confidence, by the giving of your promises to each other, of which we are witnesses, and by the tokens of commitment you have exchanged, I pronounce you, Keith and Eliza, to be husband and wife. You may kiss.

# Presentation
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my privilege to present to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Marcum.
